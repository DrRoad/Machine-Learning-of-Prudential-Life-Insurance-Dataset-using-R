# What exactly the Data is?
In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.

The result? People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance. Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly impact public perception of the industry.

The results will help Prudential better understand the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling us to significantly streamline the process.

In this dataset, you are provided over a hundred variables describing attributes of life insurance applicants. The task is to predict the "Response" variable for each Id in the test set. "Response" is an ordinal measure of risk that has 8 levels.

###### File descriptions

train.csv - the training set, contains the Response values
test.csv - the test set, you must predict the Response variable for all rows in this file
